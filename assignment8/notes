remove stop words and count the frequency 
bygram frequency -- two words together Ex. "it was" ignore space and pancuation.
calculate the probability of all the words and bygrams
create sentences : choose a bygram randomly --then pick the second word and all the bygrams that are with that word as first ( weighted by probability of those). do that for 5 times

what are the word vectors and find the cosine between the two documents.
